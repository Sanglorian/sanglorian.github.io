During setup, the Setup Player nominates one Hero character (including Mobs). If that character is  Disabled at the beginning of one of the Hero's turns, and Disabled at the end of the same turn, the Adversary wins.  

If the Troll is Disabled at the beginning of one of the Adversary's turn, and Disabled at the end of the same turn, the Adversary loses.

If the Champion and the Lieutenant are Disabled at the beginning of one of the Hero's turns, and Disabled at the end of the same turn, the Adversary wins.

**Large:** [barrel, pushing them in front of you; leaping, over them - or bring back the galumph, which is a leap ending in a barrel?]
