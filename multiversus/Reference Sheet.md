# Actions and Reactions
A reaction never stops an action from occurring, with the exception of an attack interrupting a Recovery and a defend interrupting an attack. Of course, if the consequences of a reaction make an action impossible (e.g. by Disabling the active character), then the action does not proceed.  

You only get one reaction regardless of whether it is triggered multiple times (e.g. if the active character attack-stunts someone else while adjacent to your character, you still only get one reaction even though it's triggered twice; you can choose whether to respond to the attack or the stunt. 

## Recovery (-)(-)
*Any character in range* can attack (A) an active character.  

Stops the recovery from proceeding. 

## Double-Attack (A)(A)
*The target* can attack (A) an active character, move (>) or stunt (!). 

*Any character adjacent to an active character that is not the target* can attack (A) an active character, move (>) or stunt (!). 

*Any character in range that is not the target* can attack (A) an active character.

## Double-Move (>)(>)
*Any character* can attack (A) the active character, move (>) or stunt (!) *if the active character leaves a square adjacent to them*, just before the active character leaves the square.

## Double-Stunt (!)(!)
*Any adjacent character* can attack (A) any active character, move (>) or stunt (!), just before the active character performs the stunt.

*Any character* can attack (A) an active character *if they are in range*, just before the active character performs the stunt.

## Double-Defend (D)(D)
Nothing.

## Attack-Defend (A)(D)
**Attack** 

*The target* can defend (D).

*Any character adjacent to an active character that is not the target* can move (>) or stunt (!), just before the active character makes the attack. 

## Attack-Move (A)(>)

**Stunt**

*Any adjacent character* can attack (A) any active character, move (>) or stunt (!), just before the active character performs the stunt.   

*Any character* can attack (A) an active character *if they are in range*, just before the active character performs the stunt or makes the attack.
