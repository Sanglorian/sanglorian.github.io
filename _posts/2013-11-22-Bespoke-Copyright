title: 'Bespoke Copyright' or 'Shareable Society' - a new brand for non-free Creative Commons licences

<p>On the Creative Commons discussion list, Mike Linksvayer said:</p><blockquote><p>To get really ahead of the curve, make a gift of another brand to putÂ the non-open NC and ND under. :)</p></blockquote><p>I put some thought into that, and while it was difficult to avoid being sarcastic or flippant ('Proprietary Society', 'Creative Uncommons', 'Share the Love'), I did come up with two possible brands that I thought could be compelling: 'Bespoke Copyright' (arguing that you should be able to choose what copyright applies to your creations) and 'Shareable Society' (advocating for the freshly-minted term 'shareable works', describing those that can be shared and adapted by any person for any purpose).</p><p>I posted them to the discussion list and sadly heard nothing back, but here they are for you:</p><p><a href="http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/local--files/source:chris-sakkas/Shareable%20SocietyBespoke%20Copyright%20%281%29.pdf">PDF</a></p><p><a href="http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/local--files/source:chris-sakkas/Shareable%20SocietyBespoke%20Copyright%20%282%29.odt">ODT</a></p>
