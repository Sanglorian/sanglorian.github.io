title: A Truly Free, Libre and Open Gift Guide - First Notes
---

<p>I've been disappointed by the gift guides provided by Creative Commons and opensource.com. Many of the products that they promoted as 'open source' or 'open' are not – they are under proprietary licences or even all rights reserved! I thought I'd promote some of the products that I treasure that are, at least in part, free, libre and open.</p><p> To make it into this series, a major part of the product must be under a free, libre and open licence. For example, <i>Conquering Corsairs –</i> in which the art is Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike qualifies, though the game rules are CC Attribution-NonCommercial – qualifies. <i>Cards against Humanity –</i> CC Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike in its entirety – does not.</p><p><!--more--></p><p><strong>Anima Prime</strong> from Berengad Games is a fast-paced tabletop roleplaying game inspired by manga and anime.
