title: 2013 in tabletop gaming - open licensing gets a mention
---

<p>Â Shannon Appelcline over at RPG.net has <a href="http://www.rpg.net/columns/designers-and-dragons/designers-and-dragons27.phtml">reviewed 2013 in tabletop RPG publishing</a>. Of particular interest is a small section on open licensing:</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Licensing Opens Up the Industry.</strong> The time of d20 is over, but it looks like Ryan Dancey permanently changed the gaming industry with his thoughts about open gaming licenses. As a result of Kickstarters, both GUMSHOE and <em>Fate</em> were released this year under Creative Commons [Attribution] and OGL licenses. The <em>Dungeon World</em> SRD was similarly licensed under the Creative Commons [Attribution licence]. Finally, the WaRP system from <em>Over the Edge</em> (1992) has been released under the OGL too.</p><p>I'm not sure that any of this will have a big impact on the industry, as Mongoose wasn't able to make much progress with their <em>RuneQuest</em> license of the late '00s, but it's an interesting trend that offers up neat possibilities.</p></blockquote>
