Multiversus aims to create tense encounters like the one above, where players push their luck against opponents with unique and asymmetrical powers, trying to keep their own information hidden while exposing the enemy's.    

# Introduction to the game
*Multiversus* (stylised as MULTIVERSUS) is a two-player tactical skirmish miniatures game where some of your powers and objectives are hidden from your opponent - until you reveal them. It's designed to be simple and quick, but with interesting and meaningful choices because you have to anticipate your opponent's motivations and actions without necessarily knowing what they are.
